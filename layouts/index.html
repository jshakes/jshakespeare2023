  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I have over 15 years of software development experience in the UK and US tech industry. During that time I have worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, from pre-seed startups to Fortune 500 companies. I have worked as an individual contributor and as a manager in high-performing engineering teams, as well as in 'army of one' cross-functional roles. I have been involved with every stage of the software development lifecycle and have written, tested, and shipped code that has been used by millions of people.</p>
  <p>I usually help clients with full-stack web development, and I specialize in browser-based technology. Iâ€™m fluent in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript and I have lots of experience with frontend frameworks like React. Most importantly, I know how to pick the right tools for the job and keep things as simple as possible.</p>
