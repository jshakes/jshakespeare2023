title: Use git hooks and husky to tell your teammates when to run npm install
description: This short tutorial shows you how you can automatically check for changes to package-lock.json after git pull and echo a notification to the command line.

A former coworker and I had a system for letting each other know about dependency changes in shared codebases. We wrote `npm install` on a post-it note and would stick it to the other personâ€™s monitor. Once the post-it note eventually lost its stickiness, we just screwed up and threw it at each other. By the end of the project, the universal sign for â€˜update your dependenciesâ€™ was to throw a random object across the room.

The only downside of this otherwise perfect system is that it doesnâ€™t scale well, especially on distributed teams. A much better solution is to use git hooks.

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) execute a command when git performs an action. They are useful for doing things like running a linter before you commit (`pre-commit`) or running a build script when a server receives a push (`post-receive`).

We want to check whether `package-lock.json` has changed when we run `git pull`, so we can use the `post-merge` hook (`git pull` being equivalent to `git fetch` + `git merge`). If the lockfile has changed, we can `echo` a notification to the user that they should run `npm install` to bring their `node_modules` directory up to date.

## Create a git hook file
In your repo, create a file called `post-merge` in `.git/hooks`:

```sh
touch .git/hooks/post-merge
```

In that file weâ€™re going to define a function that checks whether a file has changed between commits, and run that function with `package-lock.json` as the argument:

```sh
function changed {
  git diff --name-only HEAD@{1} HEAD | grep "^$1" > /dev/null 2>&1
}

if changed 'package-lock.json'; then
  echo "ðŸ“¦ package-lock.json changed. Run npm install to bring your dependencies up to date."
fi
```

You could add notifications for other file changes in here, like `Gemfile.lock` or `Podfile.lock`.

## Test the hook
Try out the hook by rewinding to a commit where you know `package-lock.json` has changed, letâ€™s say 20 commits ago, then running `git pull` to fast-forward back to now:

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~20 && git pull
```

If package-lock.json changed between now and then, you will see the notification.

## Use husky to share your hook with others
Changes in the `.git` directory are not version controlled, so we need to move our hook to somewhere that is. We then need to provide a way for other developers to easily install the hook for themselves. Thankfully [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) exists to do exactly that.

Create a directory called `.githooks` and move your hook there:

```sh
mkdir .githooks && mv .git/hooks/post-merge .githooks
```


Now we can set up husky. The npm post-install script for husky checks `package.json` for any declared hooks and automatically installs them in `.git/hooks`. 

In `package.json` add:

```json
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
     "post-merge": "./.githooks/post-merge"
  }
}
```

Then install husky:

```sh
npm install --save-dev husky
```

Next time someone runs `npm install` with your changes, the hook will be installed in their local `.git` directory.
