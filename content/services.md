## Software engineering

## Why should you hire me?

 have over 12 years of software development experience in the UK and US tech industries. During that time I have worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, from pre-seed startups to Fortune 500 companies. I have worked as an individual contributor and as a manager in high-performing engineering teams, as well as in 'army of one' cross-functional roles. I have been involved with every stage of the development lifecycle and have written, tested, and shipped code that has been used by millions of people.

As a contractor I work mostly with early-to-mid-stage startups, helping them get from loose product requirements to robust customer-facing technical solutions through rapid, iterative, and highly collaborative processes. I place a high value on planning, communication, and testing as a recipe for stress-free projects and high quality end-products.
