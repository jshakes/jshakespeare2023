I am available to hire as a software engineer and/or consultant. For rates and availability please email me at j@jshakespeare.com.

## Software engineering

You can hire me as a software engineer on a day rate or project rate. Most clients hire me to work in their product or engineering team, but I also excel as a full-service engineer and when deployed in cross-functional teams.

I specialize in front-end web development that incorporates UX best-practices. I have formal design training and I excel at building easy-to-use and visually delightful software without the need for costly design/engineering waterfall processes.

I mostly work remotely from my home in London but can travel as needed.

References and work examples available upon request.

## Consulting

You can also hire me as a consultant on your next project. Some things I specialize in are product strategy, web technology and infrastructure, design systems, web accessibility, and how to hire and manage an engineering team. I can also provide code review and codebase health checks/audits.

## Why should you hire me?

I have over 15 years of professional software development experience in the UK and US. During that time I have worked with businesses of all shapes and sizes, from pre-seed startups to Fortune 500 companies. I have worked as an individual contributor and as a manager in high-performing engineering teams, as well as in 'army of one' cross-functional roles. I have been involved with every stage of the software development lifecycle and have written, tested, and shipped code that has been used by millions of people.

As a contractor I work mostly with early-to-mid-stage startups, helping them get from loose product requirements to robust customer-facing technical solutions through rapid, iterative, and highly collaborative processes. I place a high value on planning, communication, and testing as a recipe for stress-free projects and high quality end-products.
