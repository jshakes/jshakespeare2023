I’ve been writing code in some form or another for over 20 years. I cut my teeth in the early-00’s learning ActionScript to power whatever silly Flash game I was making (RIP Macromedia) and HTML to customise my MySpace profile (RIP `<marquee>`; Tom). 

A lot has changed since those halcyon days spent straining my G4 processor to run pirated Macromedia software in my teenage bedroom. Nowadays I spend most of my time in my home office, straining an M2 to do whatever it is Docker does, and writing TypeScript and HTML to power whatever SPA I’m currently working on.

Maybe things haven’t changed much after all…

## AFK

In the real world I enjoy cycling, very long walks, and generally being outdoors. I like being on or in water in pretty much any form. I like cooking and eating things that I or other people have cooked. I’m a sucker for TV quiz shows and I will die happy if I ever appear on Only Connect.
